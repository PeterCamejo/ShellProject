* Working Features:

(1) bye (2) cd w/o filepath (3) cd w/ filepath (4) setenv (5) printenv

* Features that require further testing:

Maybe setenv and printenv, but I believe they are fine.

*	Current Bugs:

After "cd w/ filepath" command, prompt shifts right by one space.Does not affect functionality.
