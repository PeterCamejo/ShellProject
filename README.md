* Working Features:

(1) bye (2) cd w/o filepath (3) cd w/ filepath (4) setenv (5) printenv (6) alias printing

* Features that require further testing:

(1)Maybe setenv and printenv, but I believe they are fine.

(2)Alias adding

*	Current Bugs:

(1)After "cd w/ filepath" command, prompt shifts right by one space.Does not affect functionality.

(2)When adding an alias, alias will be added even if an alias of the same name already exists in table. Likely a simple fix, but imma take a break k.
